Description: Constructing synthetic population network by specified age distribution, contact frequency and household structures. The package allows 
  dynamic simulation of contact networks and disease trasmission in the synthetic population. Applicaiton of the package to COVID-19 modelling for Low- 
  and middle- income coountries (LMICs) is presented in Jiang et al 2021 MedRxiv -- Modelling the impact of rapid tests, tracing and distancing in 
  lower-income countries suggest optimal policies varies with rural-urban settings.
